# 💻 PC Chat Assistant Executer

A Python-based assistant that can execute system commands and help manage your computer.

## 🚀 Introducing Our New AI Laptop Assistant!

Ever wished you could chat with your laptop and get things done instantly? Now you can! 🎉
I've built a tool that allows you to control and interact with your laptop via chat—no more digging through settings or searching for solutions manually. Unlike ChatGPT, which sometimes feels too generic or slow, this assistant is tailored to your specific laptop tasks! This assistant does all your tasks seamlessly and also provides feedback.

## 🔹 What Can It Do?

✅ Answer laptop-related queries effortlessly (e.g., check system specifications like RAM and storage)

✅ Perform system tasks based on your commands (e.g., delete specific files from designated folders)

✅ Handle all execution-related tasks for Docker, Git, and ongoing OS processes (e.g., executing Docker commands without opening a terminal)

✅ Monitor and manage system performance in real-time (e.g., track running processes and RAM consumption)

✅ Automate repetitive tasks to enhance productivity

✅ Troubleshoot software issues and provide quick resolutions

✅ Execute scripts and commands without manual intervention

✅ Act as your personal system engineer to optimize workflows

✅ Install specific applications as needed

✅ Maintain security by manually requesting admin passwords for any sudo operations

## 📌 Future Scope

Manage multiple cloud OS instances via SSH—all from a single chatbot interface. This assistant will not only handle local tasks but also help manage remote servers seamlessly from one unified chat interface! 🌍
Additionally, we can use a locally installed LLM for handling SSH key exposure securely.
